<h2>🚀 About Me</h2>

<p>
  I am a learner of the <strong>ALX Software Engineering Program</strong> and I'm currently focused on building real-world skills in <strong>Frontend Development</strong>, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more.
</p>

<p>
  I started learning software engineering because I'm passionate about creating tools that <strong>improve people's lives</strong> — especially in areas like mental health, productivity, and financial empowerment.
</p>

<p>
  What inspires me is the chance to build technology that feels <em>human</em> — not just functional. I believe in using code to bring people closer to peace, purpose, and each other.

<h2>🌟 Fun Fact</h2>

<p>I learn best by doing — I’m a hands-on (kinesthetic) learner. When I code, I also reflect deeply. I think tech should help us feel more human, not just automate us.</p>
