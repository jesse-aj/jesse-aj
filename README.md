<!-- 🧠 ABOUT ME -->
### 👨🏾‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m **Jesse Appiah**, a passionate **learner and early-career software engineer** who believes technology can make life more meaningful and humane.  
I started with **software engineering** because I wanted to **create solutions that help people grow — in health, productivity, and daily life**.  

What drives me is building products that **solve real human problems**, especially for **youth and communities in Africa**, while staying scalable to global audiences.  
I’m inspired by the idea that **code can save lives**, connect people, and build opportunities for those who’ve been overlooked.

### 🌱 My Mission

To use technology to:
- Empower young people mentally, financially, and emotionally.
- Build systems that connect communities and make support accessible.
- Create tools that make humans—not machines—the center of innovation.

I’m currently focused on growing as a **full-stack engineer** and expanding my skills in **AI** and **Cybersecurity** to build safer, smarter, and more meaningful digital spaces.
